# RideShareApp

Full ride share app built with Android Studio and Firebase. 
This app allows users to create an account, log in, and post rides that they are offering or looking for. 
Users have the ability to sort rides based on date created. 
Rides can be edited and deleted by the user who posted them.
Rides can be claimed by the reciprocating user so if a driver posts a ride, a rider can claim it and vice versa.
